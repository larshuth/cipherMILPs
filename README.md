# cipherMILPs
We are building a small framework for us to use in the analysis of MILPs + cryptanalysis

**To Do:**
- [ ] To ensure corrrectness of implemented algorithms add
  - [ ] Unit tests for all modules/classes/functions and
  - [ ] Integration tests,
- [ ] Convex Hull option,
- [ ] better ReadMe,
- [ ] and constant code optimization
