def main (rounds, cipher, viz):
    '''
    Examines the structures of constraint matrices for given ciphers by generating constraints, the corresponding matrices and trying different sorting techniques.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    rounds      :   int
                    Number of rounds used for network
    
    ciphers     :   list of strings
                    Indicates the names of the ciphers used for the encryption
    
    constraints :   list of strings
                    Indicates the names of the methods used to generate the constraints
    
    structures  :   list
                    Indicates the names of the functions used to examine the structures of the constraint matrices

    dir         :   string
                    The name of the directory in which the results should be saved

    Returns:
    ----------
                :   files
                    Contains the constraints as a string and corresponding structured constraint matrices as tikz code (??)
